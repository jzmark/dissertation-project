This is my Year 3 final dissertation project written in Kotlin.

The project was titled "A User-Friendly Software Platform for Reminiscence Therapy" - which in short is an Android app developed in Kotlin to support people suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.

"The solution to the presented problem is an Android-based application. It is designed for tablet-sized devices in landscape mode only, as a larger screen size is the key to easier Human-Computer Interaction for older adults. 
This app was designed in Android Studio using Kotlin programming language, SQLite 
databases and XML layout formatting. All data uploaded to the app is kept securely in the 
database and is persistent. This allows for a seamless experience where users do not have to 
re-upload data after closing the app."

My dissertation paper is available in the repository, titled "dissertation.pdf" located in the root folder.
